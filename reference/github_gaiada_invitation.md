# Gaia Digital Agency — GitHub Organisation Invitation

**Welcome to Our Collaborative Development Platform**

You are invited to join the **Gaia Digital Agency Organisation** on GitHub. This platform will serve as our central hub for code collaboration, project management, and knowledge sharing across all active and upcoming projects.

A **sample repository and project workflow** has been configured to demonstrate our standardised processes. Please review this document to understand how we'll operate as a team.

## Team Access Structure

| Role | Access Level | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Web Dev Team | Write/Contributor | Active development, PR creation, code reviews |
| Project Managers | Read/Triage | Monitor progress, manage project boards |
| Stakeholders | Read | View activities and project status |

## 1. Pull Request (PR) Workflows & Code Review

All code changes will go through our Pull Request workflow. Direct commits to `main` or `develop` branches are restricted.

### How It Works

When you complete a feature or fix, create a PR from your feature branch to the target branch. Your PR will require at least one approval before merging.


## 2. Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment. This ensures code quality and reduces manual deployment errors.

### Automated Workflows

**On Pull Request:** Linting and code style checks run automatically, along with unit tests and build verification. PRs cannot be merged if checks fail.

**On Merge to Main:** Production builds are triggered automatically with deployment to staging or production environments. Notifications are sent to the team channel upon completion.

## 3. Advanced Project Management (GitHub Projects)

We leverage GitHub Projects for task tracking and sprint management. This keeps code and project management in one place.

### Project Board Structure

Our boards follow a Kanban-style workflow with these columns: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done.

### Working with Issues

Each task is created as a GitHub Issue with a clear title, description, acceptance criteria, labels for categorisation (e.g., `enhancement`, `bug`, `priority-high`), and assignment to the responsible developer.

## 4. Knowledge Management with README

Every repository must have a well-maintained README.md. This is the first thing anyone sees and serves as the project's documentation homepage.

## Getting Started: Register and Setup GitHub (If You Don't Have an Account)

**Registration Link:** [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

#### Quick Setup Steps:
1. **Sign up** at the link above with your email address
2. **Verify your email** - GitHub will send you a verification email
3. **Choose a username** - This will be your GitHub identity (e.g., github.com/yourusername)
4. **Configure Git locally in your terminal** with your GitHub email (for web dev cli workflow):

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-github-email@example.com"
   ```

#### If You Already Have a GitHub Account

If you already have a GitHub account, please share:
- Your GitHub email address (the one you registered with)

We can then help you get into the Gaiada Organization Github Team.

**Once you've either registered or shared your existing GitHub email, let us know and we'll send you the Gaida Organization Team Github**

### Step A: Accept Your Invitation
